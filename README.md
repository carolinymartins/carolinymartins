## 👩‍💻 About Me

Hey there! I'm Caroliny, but you can call me **Cacau**. I'm 20 years old and currently pursuing a degree in **Information Systems** at [UNOESTE](https://www.unoeste.br/graduacao/faculdade-de-sistemas-informacao). I graduated as a **Computer Technician** from [ETEC](https://www.cps.sp.gov.br/etec/) in 2021.

My journey in tech started when I was 15, during my technical course. At the time, I had no idea what programming was — but it quickly became something I loved. Since then, I’ve been diving deeper into the world of computing, always eager to learn more.
